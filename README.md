#  Linux-OS-in-C-Programming: Build Your Own Command-Line Operating System from Scratch
This project is a fully functional prototype of a Linux-like command line interface (CLI), designed to simulate the behavior and feel of a real Unix/Linux terminal. Built with simplicity and extensibility in mind, it allows users to interact with the system using typed commands, just like in a traditional shell environment.
Whether you're executing basic file operations, navigating directories, or triggering custom functionalities, this CLI mimics the core experience of Linux terminals. It’s ideal for learning, experimenting, or integrating into larger systems where a lightweight shell interface is needed.
✨ Features
- Command Parsing: Supports user-defined commands with arguments and flags.
- Directory Navigation: cd, ls, and path traversal implemented.
- File Operations: Create, delete, rename, and view files using intuitive commands.
- Custom Commands: Easily extendable to add your own functional behaviors.
- Error Handling: Graceful handling of invalid commands and inputs.
- Prompt System: Dynamic prompt that reflects current working directory.
- Modular Design: Clean separation of logic for easy maintenance and upgrades.
